\description{
A list of dataset containing simulated data to be used in the vignette, generated as follow.
Twenty reference time profiles were generated on nine equally spaced time points and assigned to four clusters (five profiles each). 
These ground truth profiles were then used to simulate new profiles (5 each).
Finally, we modelled expression of new sampled profiles as a function of time.
