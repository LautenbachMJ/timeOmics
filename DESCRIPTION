Description: timeOmics is a generic data-driven framework to integrate 
multi-Omics longitudinal data measured on the same biological samples and select 
key temporal features with strong associations within the same sample group.
The main steps of timeOmics are: 
  1. Normalization and filtering steps; 
  2. modelling to have one time profile per biological feature;
  3. clustering to group features with the same expression profile over time;
  4. post-hoc validation step.
